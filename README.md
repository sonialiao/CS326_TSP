## Problems & Solutions
Problem: Campus Big, Legs Short, Wind Strong 

Solution: We would like to build a web application that allows you to select locations on campus such as Morrill, CS Building, LGRT, etc. and the app will provide an optimal route between them.

Key Features: The background server will be able to look up the location of buildings and run a Traveling Salesman solver of some sort to return a route.
Users will be able to add and remove available locations to select
If we have more time, we can try to pull data from SPIRE so that you can input classes instead of locations.
